# Configuration
Create a `craft-commerce-back-in-stock.php` file under your `/config` directory with the following options available to you. You can also use multi-environment options to change these per environment.

The below shows the defaults already used by Back In Stock, so you don't need to add these options unless you want to modify the values.

```php
<?php

return [
    '*' => [
        'pluginName' => 'Back In Stock',
        'hasCpSection' => true,
        'stockThreshold' => 0,
        'includeAvailableForPurchase' => false,
        'sendConfirmation' => false,
        'confirmationEmailTemplate' => 'craft-commerce-back-in-stock/emails/confirmation',
        'confirmationEmailSubject' =>'Back in stock notification confirmation for {{ variant.title }}',
        'emailTemplate' => 'craft-commerce-back-in-stock/emails/notification',
        'emailSubject' => 'Order today, {{ variant.title }} is now in stock',
        'purgeRequests' => false,
    ]
];
```
